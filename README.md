Run
---

You need Mono, forge, and fake to run the API. There are two branches: the
`master` branch is the in-memory solution (which is buggy), and the `postgres`
branch is the persistent solution. To run the `postgres` branch:
create the database and apply the migrations (scripts located in the migrations
folder).

```
git checkout postgres
forge fake run
Go to http://localhost:8080 and visit one of the above endpoints
```

TODO
----
Dockerfile  
Remove superfluous museumId from nested paintings collection
